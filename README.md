# Movies Network

A Web application to view relations between actors. The application uses [IMDbPY](http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/) to access information from [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/).

# Setup and running

You will need Python 2.7+.installed.

First, install python dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, run the backend:

```bash
cd moviesnetwork
./manage runserver
```

To check if it's working, access http://127.0.0.1:8000 (or the address you used in runserver) and check if a Django page was displayed.
